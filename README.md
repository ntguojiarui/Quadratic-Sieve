# Quadratic-Sieve
We improve the algorithm of quadratic sieve in factorizing large integers. However, due to unknown error, the programme may fail when it attempts to factorize a integer greater than 150 bits.

## How to run the programme
Use command `make` to generate the executive file and type `./qs` to run the programme.
